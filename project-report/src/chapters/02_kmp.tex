\chapter{Kotlin Multiplatform}\label{ch:kotlin-multiplatform}

This chapter provides an overview of the Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) technology, including its architecture, template structure, and other aspects relevant to the development of a multiplatform library.
This technology allows developers to share code across multiple platforms, such as Android and iOS for mobile applications, and/or JVM, JavaScript and Native for multiplatform overall.


\section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}

A KMP project is divided into three main categories of code:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common}: Code shared between all platforms (i.e., \textit{CommonMain, CommonTest});
    \item \textbf{Intermediate}: Code that can be shared on a subset of platforms (i.e., \textit{AppleMain, AppleTest});
    \item \textbf{Specific}: Code specific to a target platform (i.e., \texttt{\textit{<Platform>Main}}, \texttt{\textit{<Platform>Test}}).
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:kmp-architecture} illustrates an example of a KMP project architecture.
Note that both the \textit{Intermediate} and \textit{Specific} categories are optional.

\subsection{Template}\label{subsec:template}

It is possible to create a KMP project from scratch, but it is recommended to use a template to facilitate the project's setup and configuration.
The official Kotlin Multiplatform template~\cite{kmp-github-template} provides a project structure
that includes the necessary configurations for building,
testing,
and deploying a multiplatform library for most platforms.

\subsection{Gradle Tasks}\label{subsec:available-gradle-tasks}

Gradle~\cite{gradle} is an open-source build automation tool for software construction which supports multiple programming languages, including Kotlin.
Offers support for all phases of a build process including compilation, verification, dependency resolving, test execution, source code generation, packaging and publishing.

In a Gradle build using Kotlin DSL (domain-specific language), a project's configuration is primarily defined in two key files:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{build.gradle.kts} - Defines a project's build configuration.
    In KMP projects, this file is used to define a project's targets, dependencies in the respective source sets, and additional configurations if needed;
    \item \textbf{settings.gradle.kts} - Defines a project's structure and modules it contains.
\end{itemize}

In Gradle, tasks are the smallest unit of work that can be executed and are used to perform specific actions. The template uses the KMP plugin, which defines several Gradle tasks to assist in building, testing, and managing a project across multiple platforms configured as targets in the respective \textit{build.gradle} file.
Some of the most relevant tasks include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{build}: Compiles and assembles the project;
    \item \textbf{allTests}: Runs the test cases for all platforms.
    To run platform-specific tests, use the \texttt{<Platform> Test} task (e.g., \textit{jvmTest});
    \item \textbf{check}: Performs various checks on the project, including running tests and performing additional operations (e.g., linting, code analysis);
    \item \textbf{clean}: Deletes the build directory, allowing for a clean build (i.e., not using cached artifacts).
\end{itemize}

A Gradle project can be organized into multiple subprojects, each with its own build file, settings and tasks.

\subsection{GitHub Actions}\label{subsec:github-actions}

The template provides workflows for GitHub Actions~\cite{github-actions}, which are used to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying a project.
The configurations for GitHub Actions are located in the \textit{.github/workflows} folder, and include the following workflows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{gradle.yml} - Builds and tests the project using Gradle against some of the available platforms.
    Runs on push and pull request git events to the default branch;
    \item \textbf{deploy.yml} - Deploys the library artifacts to a repository in Maven Central~\cite{maven-central}, following a pre-defined authentication configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Folder Structure}\label{subsec:folder-structure}

The template is organized into several folders, each serving a specific purpose.
Below is a brief description of each folder, with an emphasis on the \textit{src} folders:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{.github/}: Contains configurations for GitHub Actions, which are used to automate tasks;
    \item \textbf{gradle/}: Contains configuration files and scripts related to the Gradle build system.
    This folder typically includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{wrapper/}: Contains the wrapper files and configurations, which standardizes a project on a given Gradle version for more reliable and robust builds~\cite{gradle-wrapper};
        \item \textbf{libs.versions.toml}: Defines the versions of the libraries and plugins used in a project, as dependencies, in a centralized manner (regularly known as version catalog~\cite{gradle-version-catalog}).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{convention-plugins/}: Encapsulates and reuses common build logic across multiple Gradle projects or modules (e.g., for publishing, testing, etc.);
    \item \textbf{library/}: Contains the source code for the library and the build configuration file.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{src/}: Contains the source code for the library, divided into multiple submodules based on the target platforms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{commonMain/}: Contains the common code shared across all platforms;
            \item \textbf{jvmMain/}: Contains the source code specific to the JVM platform;
            \item \textbf{jsMain/}: Contains the source code specific to the JavaScript platform;
            \item \textbf{iosMain/}: Contains the source code specific to the iOS platform;
            \item \textbf{androidMain/}: Contains the source code specific to the Android platform;
            \item And all of these module counterparts for the test code (e.g., \textit{commonTest, jvmTest, jsTest, etc}).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{build.gradle.kts}: Defines the targets, dependencies, and additional configurations for the library;
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{build.gradle.kts}: The main build configuration file for the project, where the subprojects common configurations are defined;
    \item \textbf{settings.gradle.kts}: Configures the Gradle build settings for the project, including the root project name and module inclusion.
\end{itemize}

For developing the KMP library, a different template structure was adopted, specifically replacing the \textit{library} module from the original template with the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{<}kmp\_library\_name\texttt{>}}: name of a KMP library in root directory;
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{apps}: defines the modules that will consume the KMP library (e.g.,\textttt{js-app}, \texttt{android-app});
        \item \textbf{lib or shared}: defines the library's code to be shared by the consuming modules;
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{src}: defines the target submodules of the library including their test counterparts (i.e., \texttt{<Platform>Main}, \texttt{<Platform>Test});
            \item \textbf{build.gradle.kts}: defines the library's dependencies, targets, and additional configurations.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The same approach was used for organizing the Ktor Client and Server Plugin modules, which are also Kotlin Multiplatform libraries.


\section{Platform-Dependent Code}\label{sec:platform-dependent-code}

As code sharing across platforms is the primary objective of KMP, it should be written as platform-independently as possible (i.e., aggregating as much code in the hierarchically higher categories).
However, it is sometimes necessary to create specific code for a given platform, regularly referred to as \textit{target}, in the following situations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Access to API's specific to the \textit{target} is required (e.g., \textit{Java's File API});
    \item The libraries available in the common category (i.e., \textit{Standard Kotlin Library}, libraries and extensions from \textit{Kotlinx}) do not cover the desired functionalities, and third-party libraries either do not support them or are avoided to reduce dependencies;
    \item When specific types and functions defined in Kotlin need to be accessed in other languages (e.g., \textit{Javascript}).
    As such, an adapter is required to communicate with the common category code,
    in Kotlin, from the native code of the \textit{target}, which can be defined in the \textit{Intermediate} or \textit{Specific} categories.
\end{itemize}

In such cases,
platform-specific implementations can be defined in the \textit{Intermediate} or \textit{Specific} categories.
One approach is through the \textit{expect/actual}~\cite{kmp-expect-actual} mechanism.
This mechanism allows for defining abstracted code and its platform-specific implementation.
However, there are other methods available for achieving platform-specific functionality,
such as the described \textit{adapter}.


\section{Supported Targets}\label{sec:supported-targets}

The project supports the following targets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JVM}: Allows running the code on the \textit{Java Virtual Machine};
    \item \textbf{JavaScript}: Allows running the code in a browser or \textit{Node.js} environment;
    \item \textbf{Android}: Allows running the code on Android devices;
    \item \textbf{Native}: Allows running the code on platforms that support \textit{Kotlin/Native}, excluding macOS and iOS, because the lack of access to the necessary hardware for testing.
\end{itemize}


\section{Kotlin Library Practices}\label{sec:kotlin-library-practices}

The library strives to follow the best practices for developing a Kotlin library, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adherence to \href{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#coding-conventions-for-libraries}{Kotlin Coding Conventions for Libraries} to ensure consistency and readability;
    \item Compliance with \href{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/api-guidelines-introduction.html}{Kotlin API Guidelines} to create a user-friendly and maintainable API.
\end{itemize}


\section{Multiplatform Considerations}\label{sec:multiplatform-considerations}

When developing a multiplatform library, it was necessary to consider the following aspects, which may be harder to manage in a multiplatform context:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concurrency}: Techniques and tools used to manage concurrency,
    ensuring thread safety and performance across platforms.
    It's important to note that KMP's concurrency model primarily revolves around coroutines,
    which may use threads depending on the platform's dispatchers.
    Understanding platform-specific concurrency models is crucial
    as the guarantees and limitations can vary significantly
    (e.g., Kotlin/Native does not rely on Java's Memory Model~\cite{java-memory-model}.
    \item \textbf{Time Representation and Measurement}:
    Strategies for representing and measuring time consistently across platforms.
    For instance, not all platforms guarantee the same precision or accuracy in time measurements, nor provide a monotonic time source;
    \item \textbf{Synchronous vs Asynchronous}: Depending on the platform, the code might need to accommodate either synchronous operations or asynchronous operations.
    For example, JavaScript being single-threaded limits operations to asynchronous execution for non-blocking behavior.
    \item \textbf{Delay without active Blocking}: Strategies for implementing delays without actively blocking the thread (e.g., can't use \textit{Thread.sleep});)
    \item \textbf{Mocking}: Strategies for mocking dependencies in tests to isolate and verify the behavior of individual components.
    \item \textbf{Logging}: Consistent implementation of logging for debugging and monitoring purposes;
\end{itemize}
